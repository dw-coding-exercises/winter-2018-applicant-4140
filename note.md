# Note for Democracy Works Project

* Currently, the search only works for a given state and city (ex `ocd-division/country:us/state:fl/place:bonifay`); could write if conditionals to digest parish and other information

* What took the most time for me was realizing that I had to parse the EDN string to a hash-map in order to use it as such

* Ran out of time to really format the elections (for example, the polling-place link could actually go somewhere)

* Used (this EDN formatter)[http://repo.tiye.me/mvc-works/edn-formatter/] to look at EDN formatting

* Referenced (Clojure for the Brave and True)[https://www.braveclojure.com/] chapters 1 and 3 to understand basic syntax/concepts

* Used (this tutorial)[http://clojure-doc.org/articles/tutorials/basic_web_development.html] to explore web development with Clojure

* Thanks for giving me the chance to explore Clojure!
